            <b>1. What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b
            ><br /><br />
            Still fairly similar:<br /><br />
            I am working at a software start-up, but on the human side.
            Initially, I would like to move into the technical side. Gathering
            experience at the job will give me a better understanding of where I
            would like to take it. Long term, I would like to try my hand at
            creating SaaS tools and building my own business.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >2. What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will
              be in Bootcamp?</b
            ><br /><br />
            My biggest strength is that I am a quick learner. My biggest
            limitation now is the lack of spare time and energy I have outside
            of work.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >3. What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at
              Bootcamp will be?</b
            ><br /><br />
            My biggest challenge is the lack of time and energy. Hopefully, work
            will be less busy going forward and I will have more energy
            available for course-related material.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >4. What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to
              see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b
            ><br /><br />
            I am happy with my human skills. I am really looking to build
            technical skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>5. What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</b
            ><br /><br />
            Clear guidance and communication about whatâ€™s expected and wanted.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>6. What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</b
            ><br /><br />
            I work full-time Monday to Friday for about 8 hours per day, but my
            job is quite mentally tiring. So to work on course material, I don't
            just need to find available time but also preserve mental energy.
            This has usually been later at night after a break from work and
            some exercise. I am aiming for 2 or 3 weeknights, plus Saturday and
            Sunday mornings, so I can still keep a portion of the weekend
            "guilt-free" after doing a good amount of coursework. When things
            build up, I will ask for an extension, but I will try to avoid
            needing to do so.
