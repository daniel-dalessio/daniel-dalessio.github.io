            <b>1 - What is your long term goal or career pathway?</b> <br />
            I am working at a software start up, but on the human side.
            Initially I would like to move into the technical side. Gathering
            experience at the job I will be able to have a better understanding
            of where I would like to take it. But long term I would like to try
            my hand at creating saas tools and making my own business.

            >
            <br />
            I am a very quick learner, but need to be motivated and excited
            about what I am learning.

              see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b
            >
            <br />I am happy with my human skills. really looking to build some
            technical skills.

            I work full time Monday to Friday for about 8 hours per day, but my
            job is quite mentally tiring. So to work on course material I don't
            need to just find time that is available, but also mental energy.
            This has usually been later at night after a break from work, and
            maybe some exercise. I am trying to do about 2 or 3 week nights,
            then a Saturday and Sunday morning, so I can still have a portion of
            weekend that is 'guilt-free' after doing a good amount of course
            work. When things build up I will ask for extension, but will try to
            not need to do so going forward.
