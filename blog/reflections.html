            <b
              >1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and
              your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</b
            ><br /><br />
            Free time doesn’t always come with the energy needed to use it
            productively, which impacts planning.<br /><br />
            Things often don't take as long as I initially think they will.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >2. What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
              learning and programming?</b
            ><br /><br />
            In a working environment, technical skills are just one part of the
            job. Being able to communicate effectively and being someone others
            enjoy working with are just as important — often key factors when
            getting hired.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >3. What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills
              learning?</b
            ><br /><br />
            I wouldn’t say there were major surprises for me.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >4. What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills
              learning?</b
            ><br /><br />
            Finding the time and energy to complete it.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so
              much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development
              Bootcamp course?</b
            ><br /><br />
            I completely understand why it’s included in the curriculum,
            especially for a younger crowd who may not have had much
            professional experience yet. At the end of the day, when hiring
            someone, you're choosing a person you'll spend around eight hours a
            day with. Hiring managers often prefer someone who is great to work
            with and communicates well, even if they’re a little less
            technically advanced. Technical skills can usually be taught more
            easily than interpersonal skills. For a school aiming to get people
            hired, focusing on these concepts is valuable.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >6. Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here
              feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
              practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</b
            ><br /><br />
            For me personally, it did feel a little bit like a waste of time. I
            already work in a people-focused role where I spend most of my week
            developing human skills — managing sensitive issues with clients,
            coordinating between teams, and communicating effectively. Because
            of this, when it comes to course-related work, I’m very eager to
            dive deeper into technical skills rather than revisiting concepts
            I’m already applying daily, specially considering I have limited
            time to spend on course material in general.
