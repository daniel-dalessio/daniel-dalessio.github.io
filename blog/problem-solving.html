            <b>1. Were you blocked on a simple problem?</b><br /><br />
            On the grade-book problem. Following the difficulty increasing pattern, I thought that problem would be more complex, so I was confused on why it didn't ask for a loop to add the students to the object. And the answer was to simply hardcode it. <br /><br />
            Learned that if it looks simple, it might just be simple.
            <br>
            In general knowing the syntax for different things. I usually google and check the reference material to check how something should be written down.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>2. Elegantly solved a problem?</b><br /><br />
            Depends on your definition of elegant. We are not doing anything resource-intensive enough to have to think about the code running super fast. So I guess it's that it answers the questions and is readable? <br /><br />
            For now I am definitely trying to focus more on code that is readable than trying to make it optimal. I don't have a specific example that stands out, I would say all my responses are on the same level of ok elegant-ness.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</b><br /><br />
            <ul>
              <li>Pseudocode – 5/5</li>
              <li>Trying something – 4/5</li>
              <li>Rubber ducky method – 4/5</li>
              <li>Reading error messages – 5/5</li>
              <li>Console.logging – 5/5</li>
              <li>Googling – 5/5</li>
              <li>Asking your peers for help – 1/5</li>
              <li>Asking coaches for help – 1/5</li>
              <li>Improving your process with reflection – 1/5</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</b><br /><br />
            Being able to solve a problem by researching/googling, reading reference guides, etc is an important skill I want to get better at. If after doing that at some point I feel like I stopped learning from the research process, am wasting time and asking is best, then I will adapt my approach.
