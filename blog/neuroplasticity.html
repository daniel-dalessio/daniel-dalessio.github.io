            <b>1. Research Neuroplasticity</b><br /><br />
            The brain isn’t fixed—it rewires based on what you do. That’s
            neuroplasticity. Repeat something enough and your brain starts
            treating it like default. It’s how habits form, how change happens.
            Understanding this helps people realise they’re not stuck. You can
            learn new things, break patterns, shift mindsets—if you give your
            brain the right signals.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, it’s like habit creation. If I want to wake up early or
            exercise regularly, I just have to keep doing it. The more I repeat
            something, the more natural it feels. Humans are adaptable—our
            brains are built for change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repetition is a big part of it, but not the only part. Sleep is
            important—your brain needs rest to rewire. Movement helps
            too—exercise actually boosts brain function. Trying new things,
            doing stuff that feels awkward or unfamiliar, that’s where new
            pathways form.

            <b>2. Research Growth Mindset</b><br /><br />
            That's something I already apply to my life in general.

            <b>3. Blend with your learning plan and strategies</b><br /><br />
            Stay consistent. There is no finish line. The reward for good work
            is more work.
