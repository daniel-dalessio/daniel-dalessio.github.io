            I work providing support to payroll managers when they have
            questions about payroll. Sometimes (thankfully not often) I
            encounter someone who doesn't want to pay the correct entitlements
            to their employees for leave or a final pay for example. I always
            try to explain the correct way of doing it and try to influence them
            to pay their employees correctly.

            I moved to new zealand by myself about 12 years ago. So the network
            of friends that I have build over the years became a family of
            sorts, and helped me adapt grow as a person.

            english is my second language. Doesn't matter how good it is, it
            likely won't ever be as good as a native speakers.

              Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
              others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies
              you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your
              reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</b

            Working in a software company, there are sometimes downtimes or bugs
            that can affect a large number of customers at once. So organising
            my team effectively in different tasks. Communicating with the
            technical team effectively to help get the problem looked at and
            fixed asap, while other people working at responding to affected
            customers, for example.
