            - An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and
            CSS.
          </h3>
          <p>
            HTML is like the puppets and the stage setup—it gives everything a
            place and structure. CSS is like the costumes and decorations—it
            makes the puppets look pretty and the stage colorful. JavaScript is
            like the puppeteer's hands—it makes the puppets move, talk, and
            interact.
          </p>

          <h3>
            -Explain control flow and loops using an example process from
            everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'
            (but not those).
          </h3>
          <p>
            Control flow is like a recipe for a meal, listing each step, while
            Loops is a way to get around repetitive tasks. for example if the
            recipe asks to chop 3 onions, you don't need to write, 'chop 1
            onion' 3 times, you can create a loop that repeats the cutting onion
            step until there are no more onions
          </p>
          <h3>
            -Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact
            with it.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a structured representation of
            your HTML file, organized as a tree of objects. This model allows
            JavaScript to interact with the HTML elements dynamically. For
            example, you might use JavaScript to select a specific header in the
            DOM and change its text or style, making the webpage interactive
            without needing to reload the page.
          </p>
          <h3>
            -Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and
            objects.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Arrays are ordered collections of data where each item is accessed
            by its index (a numerical position starting at 0). Objects are
            collections of data stored as key-value pairs, where each piece of
            data is accessed by its key (a descriptive name).
          </p>
          <h3>-Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
          <p>
            Functions are blocks of reusable code designed to perform a specific
            task. They allow you to encapsulate a piece of logic that you can
            run whenever needed, which helps keep your code organized and avoids
            repetition.
